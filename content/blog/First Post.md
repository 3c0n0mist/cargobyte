Unfortunately, there is no singular low-priced way to ship packages. Rates are always influenced by the factors listed below. 
1. **Speed**
 
 Keep in mind, shipping price positively correlates with the delivery speed. The faster you want your package to get to its destination, the more you will have to pay. So first, define if you want your package to be delivered the next day, within two-three days, or you can wait for a week. 
 Time-sensitive options vary from one company to another, so make sure you are really ready to pay the price they set. Note that the price for overnight delivery may be five times higher than that for standard shipping. 
 
 2. **Distance**
 
 Once you’ve decided when you want to get your package, consider the shipping zone of your package. There are eight shipping zones in the US, so you should check how far your destination is before you order a service. Obviously, the longer distance your package has to travel, the more expensive it will be. Moreover, be especially attentive with international deliveries as their rates are significantly higher than domestic ones. 
 
 3. **Weight and size**
 
 Another crucial factor defining the rates is the weight of your package. So the next step for choosing a shipping organization is to monitor its rates depending on how heavy or light your parcel is. Size or, in other words, space that a package occupies also affects the amount of money you’ll have to pay. 
 
 4. **Insurance**

 If you want to mitigate any risks related to the loss or damage of your package, then monitor what shipping companies offer insurance. Making the parcel secure typically costs extra money, so the research of the cheapest options may take some time. However, there are many carriers with competitive rates to choose from.
