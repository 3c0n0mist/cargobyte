  <p>Students often live on a tight budget, which makes them save money on everything they buy.
Most of them try to find cheaper goods or services to cut down expenses, and shipping is no exception.</p>
<p>Hence, this guide is aimed to help students opt for the most affordable shipping service depending on a few factors.</p>
<p><strong>Keep reading to learn more!</strong>  Key rate factors to consider</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no singular low-priced way to ship packages. Rates are always influenced by the factors listed below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind, shipping price positively correlates with the delivery speed. The faster you want your package to get to its destination, the more you will have to pay. So first, define if you want your package to be delivered the next day, within two-three days, or you can wait for a week.
Time-sensitive options vary from one company to another, so make sure you are really ready to pay the price they set. Note that the price for overnight delivery may be five times higher than that for standard shipping.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Distance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve decided when you want to get your package, consider the shipping zone of your package. There are eight shipping zones in the US, so you should check how far your destination is before you order a service. Obviously, the longer distance your package has to travel, the more expensive it will be. Moreover, be especially attentive with international deliveries as their rates are significantly higher than domestic ones.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Weight and size</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another crucial factor defining the rates is the weight of your package. So the next step for choosing a shipping organization is to monitor its rates depending on how heavy or light your parcel is. Size or, in other words, space that a package occupies also affects the amount of money you’ll have to pay.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Insurance</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to mitigate any risks related to the loss or damage of your package, then monitor what shipping companies offer insurance. Making the parcel secure typically costs extra money, so the research of the cheapest options may take some time. However, there are many carriers with competitive rates to choose from.  </p>
<p>A few words about shipping business from essay services</p>
<p>As was said above, the shipping business is evolving very rapidly under the influence of the latest technologies.</p>
<p>Hence, it’s a common topic for discussion at schools and universities. Many educators find it essential to teach students about the importance of efficient shipping for retail companies.</p>
<p>They assign some tasks that could provide a deeper understanding of how to build and optimize delivery processes. To complete their assignments, young people are looking for information at the most reliable UK service for essay writing, which offers a lot of helpful materials on distribution.</p>
<p>Experts working at this service explain how companies can use shipping innovations to boost their performance and get better financial outcomes.
Choosing the best way to ship USPS
When shipping lightweight packages under 1 pound internationally, it would be better to use USPS since it has the most competitive rates.
This service is also the most convenient one for 2-3-day shipping.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FedEx</strong>
FedEx offers the lowest rates for heavy packages and two-day international delivery. It’s also the most cost-efficient service for overnight delivery.</li>
<li><strong>DHL</strong>
If you need to make a domestic shipment, DHL rates are typically more affordable than those at FedEx.SeaRatesWhen it comes to cargo delivery,</li>
<li><strong>Model Cargo</strong>
can complete ship containers at the port of destination for a moderate price.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>As you see there is a wide range of possibilities to ship something for little money. Different services make deliveries within different timeframes. Therefore, the shipping price depends on how fast the transportation will be performed. What’s more, the parcel weight determines the rate as well. Therefore, depending on delivery timeframes and a parcel type, you can choose a company that will save you money. All you need is just to weigh all pros and cons of a certain transportation service and decide whether it meets all your needs.</p>
